## Introduction
This repository stores data and code of using deep learning methods for solving Directed Steiner Tree problems, and the data are all included in json files.

## Data description
The title of each file denotes graph type and scale, such as "PL_100" representing a power law graph and scale of 100 (i.e., 100 nodes). Each file consists of weights, adjacency lists, problem instances, optimal solutions to problem instances via a DP algorithm, the probabilities of nodes whether they belong to optimal solutions given by the deep learning model, and the solutions to problem instances via deep learning.

## Training tricks

## Updates
The updates of data will be announced later.
